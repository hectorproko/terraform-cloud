#Terraform expects that both S3 bucket and DynamoDB resources are already created before we configure the backend. So, let us run terraform apply to provision resources.
# # #Configure S3 Backend
# terraform {
#   backend "s3" {
#     bucket         = "hector-dev-terraform-bucket"
#     key            = "global/s3/terraform.tfstate"
#     region         = "us-east-1"
#     dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
#     encrypt        = true
#   }
# }
